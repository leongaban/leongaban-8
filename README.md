<p>I have a passion for crafting user experiences, if the web was built with LEGO Iâ€™d probably be using those some how.While designing or coding I prefer listening to ambient music or a podcast, I follow the people over at scotch.io, css-tricks and read on smashing magazine to stay updated in the industry. Also I'm constantly absorbing content on the newest technologies. Currently on the path of the full <a href="http://mean.io/">MEAN stack</a> ninjaneer.</p>

<p>My favorite code editor is Sublime Text 2. For pleasure I listen to a multitude of podcasts including Radiolabs, Let's talk Bitcoin, Hardcore History and the Joe Rogan podcast, for hobbies I love training in Brazillian jui-jitsu and Bikram yoga.

    --- models        # Database Schema Models
    --- routes        # Rest api endpoints for routing
    --- views         # Swig based html rendering

**Client**

All of the Client side code resides in the `/public` directory.

    public            
    --- assets        # Javascript/Css/Images (not aggregated)
    --- controllers   # Angular Controllers
    --- config        # Contains routing files

### Heroku
Before you start make sure you have the [Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
installed and an accessible MongoDB instance - you can try [MongoHQ](http://www.mongohq.com/)
which has an easy setup).

Add the db string to the production env in *server/config/env/production.js*.

```bash
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "initial version"
$ heroku apps:create
$ heroku config:add NODE_ENV=production
$ heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/mbuchetics/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-grunt.git
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production
```
