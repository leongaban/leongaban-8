<p>If the web was built with LEGO Iâ€™d probably be using those some how, I have a passion for crafting pleasing user experiences.</p>

<p>I'm constantly absorbing content on the newest technologies. Currently on the path of the full <a href="http://mean.io/">MEAN stack</a> ninjaneer.</p>

<p>My favorite code editor is Sublime Text 2. For pleasure I listen to a multitude of podcasts including Radiolabs, Let's talk Bitcoin, Hardcore History and the Joe Rogan podcast, for hobbies I love training in Brazillian jui-jitsu and Bikram yoga.
